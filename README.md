This app let's the user set timers and alarms to the tone, song, or radio of their choosing and set events on a calendar. 



It will allow the user to link either an iHeartRadio or Spotify account to the app to use a specific song or an entire radio to alarms they have set. It would also have them link their Google calendar if they so wish. The user would be asked to link any of these upon starting the app for the first time, they then can opt out if they so wish to do so. The app will make sure to keep the user signed in to Google, Spotify or iHeart along with keeping all events on the calendar and all alarms that have been set, whether the app is actively running or not.

The user will be able to scroll through a list of alarms and edit them as well as switch over to the calendar and scroll through it and select specific days and times to set events.
