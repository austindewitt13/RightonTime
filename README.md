# Right on Time

My app is pretty clean cut, it essentially let's you set timers and alarms to the tone, song, or radio of your choosing and set events on a calendar. I believe this would appeal to just about anyone that lives in the modern age.

Online Services & Persistent Data:

The app would be able to use either an iHeartRadio or Spotify API to link either a specific song or an entire radio to alarms they have set. It would also have them link their Google calendar if they so wish. The user would be asked to link any of these upon starting the app for the first time, they then can opt out if they so wish to do so. The app would need to make sure to keep the user signed in to Google, Spotify or iHeart along with keeping all set events on the calendar and all alarms that have been set.

Navigation:

I was thinking that the bottom button navigation would work quite nicely with switching between the calendar and alarm list. You would be able to scroll through a list of alarms and edit them as well as switch over to the calendar and scroll through it and select specific days and times to set events.
