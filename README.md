# Right on Time

The user will be required to sign into Google Sign In upon booting the app for the first time.
The user is able to add an alarm at the time of their choosing via a floating action button.
The user can then decide to delete, pause or start an alarm. They can switch between
day and night mode and access a calendar view although the calendar view is currently 
not completely functional.
