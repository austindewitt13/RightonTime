## Milestone

 Currently the user can navigate from Alarms to Calendar via the bottom buttons labeled 
 Alarms and Calendar and back and is able to add alarms into the listview via the floating 
 action button, although they currently cannot make a custom set time, it simply inputs a
 string into the view and adds the values into the room database, it will eventually allow 
 the user to enter a specific time and tone, song, or radio station of their choosing.
