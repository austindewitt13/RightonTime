##How to Use My App

Upon booting the app for the first time, it will prompt you to sign in with Google Sign In.
Once you proceed past the sign in you can now access everything that the app has in it.

In the top right corner there is a button to sign out of Google Sign In but it is required
to use the app.

Use the bottom button navigation to switch between day and night mode,
set alarms, and calendar.Upon pressing either day or night mode 
you will have to return to the view you were previously using, the mode you pick will
persist across the entire app.

When you press on the set alarm button you will be presented with a listview that is
not yet populated. You can populate the list with alarms by pressing the floating
action button in the bottom right corner, it will then prompt you to pick an hour 
and minute with a Timepicker Dialog or you can switch the dialog to a text edit dialog.
Once the alarm is populated in the list it will sound off at the time of your choosing.
There are three buttons in the list with alarm, these are delete, start and stop, from 
left to right. Delete will completely remove the alarm, start will turn on the alarm,
and stop will stop the alarm from going off until the start button is pressed.

Pressing the calendar button will take you to the calendar view. This view is incomplete
and only allows the user to swipe through months and click on days but nothing will happen.
Same for typing in the text field or pressing the add button.
