## Current State of Application

 Upon booting up the app for the first time it will ask the User to enter in their 
 credentials for Google Sign In. 
 
 Currently the user can navigate from Alarms to Calendar via the bottom buttons labeled 
 Alarms and Calendar and back and is able to add alarms into the listview via the floating 
 action button. They then can either pause, resume, or delete the alarm from the list. 
 It also will have display a notification when the alarm goes off. 
 
 The user can also change between day and night mode with the bottom buttons.
 
 The calendar is currently not completely functional, it does allow the user to see dates
 and press on a date but nothing will happen.
